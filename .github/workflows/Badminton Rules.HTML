<h1 style="font-family:Starcraft;">Basics of Badminton!</h1>
</center>
<br>

</br>
<p><i> <font size="4">The aim of badminton is to hit the shuttle with your racket so that it passes over the net and lands inside
your opponent’s half of the court. Whenever you do this, you have won a rally; win enough rallies, and you win the match. </i></p>
<hr>

<h1> Faults </h1>

<li> Touch the net with any part of their body or racket while the shuttlecock is in play.
<li> Hit the shuttlecock on the ceiling or drop it outside the court lines.
<li> Striking the shuttlecock twice on the same side of the court.
<li> Serving on the opposite side of the net. i.e. not serving in the diagnal boxes.
<li> Striking the shuttlecock twice on the same side of the court.
<li> Bad behavior shown by the players
<li> The receiver’s partner receives the serve,(in case of a doubles match).

<hr> 

<h1>How to win the points!</h1>

<li> You can win points from opponent’s mistakes for example,if he hits the shuttle into or under the net, or out of court, then you win the rally.
<li> If you serve/ hit the shuttle to your opponent and if it lands in the designated court areas and they <b> do not </b> relay it back, you will win a point. 
<li> If your opponent double hits the shuttle with racket to make it cross the net.
<li> Shuttle hitting body of the opponent player before it reaches the groud.
<li> Your opponent returning shot after it hits the ground.
<li> If your opponent commits a fault.
<li> If you lift your whole foot of the groung while serving.

<h1>Key Rules!</h1>

<li class="large-font"> Played on a court 20 feet by 44 feet.
<li class="large-font"> A match is played up to 21 point
<li class="large-font"> A match 20-20 the side first to achieve a two-point lead wins.
<li class="large-font">If the points are still tied at 29-29 then the next point will decide the winner of the set.
<li class="large-font"> Winning the overall game will require you to win 2 out of the 3 sets played.
<li class="large-font"> A serve must be hit underarm and below the servers waist. No overarm serves are allowed.
<li class="large-font">Each game will start with a toss to determine which player will serve first and which side of the court the opponent would like to start from.
<li class="large-font">If a player touches the net with any part of their body or racket then it is deemed a fault and their opponent receives the point.
<li class="large-font">Each game is umpired by a referee on a high chair who overlooks the game. There are also line judges who monitor if the shuttlecock lands in or not. 
<li class="large-font"> The referee has overriding calls on points and faults.
<li class="large-font">The game has only two rest periods coming the form of a 90 second rest after the first game and a 5 minute rest period after the second game.
<li class="large-font">The referee can deduct points from a player who repeatedly breaks the rules. If a player persists in fouling, they may lose the set or the match.

<h1> Court Lines! </h1>

<p class="large-font">When you first look at a badminton court, you could be forgiven for thinking it has too many lines. This is mainly because the court is marked up for both singles and doubles, which use slightly different court sizes.
The outermost lines form the doubles court. So in a doubles rally, the shuttle is allowed to land anywhere on the court.
The singles court is slightly narrower than the doubles court. The singles side lines are not the outermost lines, but the next ones in. Taken together with the outermost (doubles) side lines, these make narrow alley shapes along the sides of the court. These alleys are often called the tramlines or side tramlines, since they look like tram or train tracks.
So here’s another way to think about it: the side tramlines are in for doubles, but out for singles.

 <h2> Serving Rules </h2> 
 
 <p> In Badminton, the serve must be hit in an upwards direction, with an underarm hitting action. You are <i>not</i> allowed to play a "tennis style" serve. The main rule here is that when you hit the shuttle, it must be <b>below</b> your waist. To be exact, the rules state that the handle of the Badminton Racket should` be at height level with the lowest part of your ribcage. 
 <p>1. The serve is made from the right side of the court for odd-numbered points and from the left side for even-numbered points. </p>
 <p>2. The serve must be hit from below the waist and the racket must make contact with the shuttlecock below the server's waist. </p>
 <p>3. The serve must be hit in an upward direction and must pass over the net and land in the receiver's service court.</p>
 <p>4. The receiver must stand in the diagonal service court and may not move until the serve is hit.</p>
 <p>5. In doubles, the receiver’s <b>partner</b> is not allowed to hit this shot. </p>
 <p>6. If the serve is good, the receiver must return it, and the rally begins. </p>
